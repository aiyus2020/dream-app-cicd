# Dream Vacation App – Dockerized 🌍🐳

This project focuses on the **containerization of a full-stack application** using Docker and Docker Compose. The app is made up of:

- A React frontend  
- A Node.js backend  
- A PostgreSQL database

---

## 🛠️ What Was Done

- The **frontend and backend code** was already provided. here [code](https://github.com/obusorezekiel/Dream-Vacation-App)
- I wrote the `Dockerfile` for both the **frontend** and **backend**.
- I created the `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate all services.
- I created a `.env` file for managing environment variables.
- A `.gitignore` file was added to prevent the `.env` file from being pushed, as it contains sensitive data like database credentials.
- Create a repository for each service:
    *dream-vacation-frontend*
    *dream-vacation-backend*

- I built and pushed the **Docker images** to **Docker Hub**.

```bash
docker build -t aiyus/dream-vacation-frontend ./frontend
docker build -t aiyus/dream-vacation-backend ./backend
docker push aiyus/dream-vacation-frontend
docker push aiyus/dream-vacation-backend

```
- I started the containers using:

```bash
docker-compose up  -d
```

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dream-Vacation-App.git
cd Dream-Vacation-App
```

### 2. Create a `.env` file at the root:

```env
POSTGRES_DB
POSTGRES_USER
POSTGRES_PASSWORD
DB_HOST
DB_PORT
PORT
```

### 3. Start the application

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

* Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Backend: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
* PostgreSQL: localhost:5432

---

## 📤 Pushed Docker Images

* **Frontend**: `docker.io/your-username/dream-vacation-frontend`
* **Backend**: `docker.io/your-username/dream-vacation-backend`

---

## ✅ Features

* Multi-stage builds for frontend optimization
* Separate services for clean separation of concerns
* Environment configuration via `.env`
* PostgreSQL data persistence using Docker volumes
* Ready for local or production Docker deployment

---




## 🛠️🌀 **CI/CD Update**

### ✨ New CI/CD Workflow Configuration

* Implemented **GitHub Actions** to automate Docker image builds and push to Docker Hub.
* Created 
`.github/workflows/frontend.yml`
`.github/workflows/backend.yml`
 which does the following on push to main:

  * Checks out the code
  * Logs in to DockerHub using GitHub secrets
  * lint the code
  * Builds frontend and backend Docker images using `docker buildx`
  * Pushes images to Docker Hub

### 🗃️ GitHub Secrets and env Used:

* `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` (env)
* `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`(secret)

## 🧾 Summary

This project demonstrates how to:

* Dockerize a full-stack application
* Use Docker Compose for service orchestration
* Push images to Docker Hub
* Automate the image build-and-push process using **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**

> 🔐 Sensitive variables like Docker credentials and `.env` contents are managed securely through `.gitignore` and GitHub secrets.
